# .xcompose.d #

This is a collection of files containing definitions for key sequences under X.

They are primarily made for use with the [neo2 keyboard layout][neo], and a
number of the sequences contain keys not found on standard QWERTY or QWERTZ
keyboards.

They are to some extent organized by theme, except for the `neo2.compose` and
the `proposed.compose`, which are explained below.

## Files ##

### The `neo2.compose` ###

The `neo2.compose` is taken directly from the website of the neo keyboard
layout at [neo-layout.org][neo]. It defines most of the standard sequences as
well as many specific to the neo2 layout and its goals. The introduction of
this file has caused some redundancies and conflicts, which are slowly being
resolved.

This file will hopefully be kept reasonably up-to date from its origin.

### The `proposed.compose` ###

This file originally held sequences that were yet to be sorted into the
hierarchy. A few of these remain, once they have been taken care of, branches
shall serve the purpose of this file, so it will then be removed.
